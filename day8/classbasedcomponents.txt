class based components came into existence in year of 2013 
with react itself. We need to concentrate on functionality 
of class components also to learn about functional Components
working for that we need to know about "STATE" To know about 
"STATE" then we need to know about "CLASS BASED COMPONENTS".
By using the "STATE" we can control the whole component 
data which is available in "CLASS BASED COMPONENTS"

STATE: State is nothing but an object which stores the component data.


For Class Based Components we need to extend from "React.Component"
In Class Based Component we must use constructor with "super()" method and 
also state with "this" keyword. By using this keyword we can access 
data of an object or an function 





Then later in period of 2018 to 2019 react 18 version came into market where we got functional components in which one of important topic is HOOKS.

Note: In real time we use functional based components

Note: Prepare on Prototype Chaining
